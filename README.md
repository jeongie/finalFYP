Automatic Data Extraction System
- In the medical domain, medical data generated everyday keep increasing and 80% of the data is unstructured. Therefore, it is difficult to be processed for secondary use which would otherwise help to achieve a higher accuracy of disease diagnosis. Automatic Data Extraction System is a system that use transfer learning to perform data extraction from unstructured to structured form of data. Extraction model using regular expression (Regex) written in Python is implemented using FLASK API.

Objective
- 1. To identify the data that needs to be extracted from unstructured medical report
  2. To develop a system to extract medical data from unstructured medical report into structured form
  3. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the system in data extraction

Functional Requirements
1. Allow user to register and login to the automatic data extraction system
2. Is capable of recognizing medical terms from unstructured medical report
3. Allow user to upload unstructured medical report in different file extensions which are .pdf, .doc and .docx to the system as an input for data extraction
4. Allow user to select type of preferred data to be extracted from the unstructured medical report to structured form
5. Provide extracted data in structured form after running the automatic data extraction system
6. Allow user to download the extracted data from the system in csv file

Extra Feature
- Live Dashboard using PowerBI
